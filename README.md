# term-ink

This combines two things I've been playing with recently

1. [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish)
2. [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink)

It uses a proto buf and acts as a client to the [Ink-GRPC-Server](https://github.com/awwithro/ink-grpc-runtime/)

All-in-all, it lets you play ink games in the terminal

See a demo with `ssh intercept.withrow.dev -p 23234`
